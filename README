Bring your own runtime to AWS Lambda!

This project offers a C compatible library for applications to
import and run on AWS Lambda. Currently supported is NodeJS,
but bindings could be written for any language.

We do NOT use a wrapper or loader, but instead offer
library methods that emulate a Golang 1.x application.

Supported language runtimes:
- NodeJS
